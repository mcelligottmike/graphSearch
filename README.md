# graphSearch
Capture graph structure and find shortest path between two given nodes

![alt text](public/img/Overview.png "Overview")

Where multiple paths qualify for the shortest path then all paths are discovered. 
We can also query the graph to discover all paths emanating from a given node to distinct leaves. 
In this case, we discover ALL shortest paths for a given source to all nodes.
